###### Firmware Update Tool

This script allows you to send a FW binary file through Bluetooth Low Energy to an ESP32 MCU. 
The script makes use of Bleak Client library which is said to work cross platform (Windows, Linux, macOS), but currently 
it has only been tested and works on Windows 10.

Install dependencies:
$pip install bleak

For more info on the library, please visit: https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Now you are able to run the script and perform a FW OTA process as follows:
python FW_UPDATE_BLE.py 'your_binary.bin'

I have attached in FW_IMAGES_TEST folder two binary files only for testing purposes, those applications are only blinking the 
onboard ESP32 LED (GPIO_NUM_2). Those binary files do not include the BLE code needed to perform a new FW OTA, so once applied you 
must reflash the board.

In order to perform the BLE update, you can modify UUID_FW_DATA to match your first UUID chars for the ESP32 BLE Characteristic 
(where you expect to receive FW data), personally I sent first the size of the new binary so in the ESP32 I can compare the expected data size and actual received data.
